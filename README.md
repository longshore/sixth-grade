_(extremely rough explanation)_ I don't think schools and adults have gotten _better_ at handling bullying and "problem students" in the past twelve years. Every popular narrative I've seen &mdash; and I've read a _lot_ children's coming-of-age literature and op-eds &mdash; about bullying and school violence lends itself easily to manichean good and evil, hero vs. bully simplification, which falsely suggest that conflict can be resolved by punishing the "bad guy" hard enough and arming the "good guy" (figuratively, like arming them with morals like "stand up for yourself", all the way through literally placing armed police officers in schools). This narrative is toxic.

I want to change the way we talk about bullying and children's social conflicts. I want adults to understand children's social conflicts enough to be compassionate, and not look for villains to punish. I want children to be surrounded by useful stories, not implicit suggestions that they need to figure out a way to one-up those who are antagonizing them in a climactic showdown.

Content notes: mainly about bullying, brief discussion of self harm/death

edit 2022: I've come to believe "smart" and "stupid" are either basically fake ideas, or worse-than-useless simplifications. If I were to share this now I'd want to redo the beginning to not rely on those concepts -- and to convey "developmentally behind agemates" without reducing it to the word "retarded".
