The repository is public, but not published.
--------------------------------------------------------
I'd appreciate it if you didn't post links to this on the general internet until everything is ready for launch. This repository is public to make it easier for collaborators to keep up to date, not as a publishing platform. I don't mind if you show this to friends on the down low, I just want to keep buzz to a minimum until it's finished and published for real.

This will most likely be made kopyleft, but until I figure that stuff out, assume default copyright.
