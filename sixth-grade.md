Hi. My name is David Longshore, and this is how I dropped out of sixth grade. I was 11 years old in 2001 when all of this happened, so there are some parts I do not remember clearly. But this story is important, and the truth is important, so I will tell it as best I can. This story is scary enough without exaggeration; I will report hyperbole that happened but not use it myself. What follows is a true retelling of what actually happened at John Sevier Middle School of Kingsport, Tennessee.

>[image: where Kingsport, TN is on a map? NE corner of TN, nearish to KY, WV, and NC.]

I am white and comfortably middle class. I have one sibling, a younger sister. Both of my parents are highly educated; my mom was a programmer for NASA before I was born, and my dad does something very clever and in-demand with radio wave amplifiers. His salary was enough that when I was born, my mom was able to retire and become a stay-at-home-mom when I was born. My parents were not disciplinarians, but neither could it be said that we were allowed to run loose. We were raised Catholic, and not allowed toy weapons or violent video games. I want to stress that nothing in my life can be attributed to poor or neglectful parenting; my parents were nothing but loving and invested in my growth and education.

Sixth grade, the first year of middle school, was easy enough at first. At an early parent-teacher conference, my teachers said that I could be teaching any of their classes. This is an example of _hyperbole_. Hyperbole is when you take a true statement, and then stretch it until you get a statement that isn't exactly true anymore but is exciting enough that people pay attention to the grain of truth within it. I would have made an awful teacher at 11 years old, but it was true that I had either already learned what they were teaching or could learn it faster than they could teach. My teachers could have said "School is too easy for him" or "He already knows this stuff," but "He could be teaching my class" gets your attention better even if it isn't 100% true. I was proud when my parents told me what my teachers had said, because I liked feeling smart.

My parents weren't. They already knew I was smart; they were angry that my teachers understood that I wasn't learning but still weren't able to get me challenging classes. This was a persistent problem for me. Two years earlier, I had been graded as reading at "Grade Level 13+" and I had to get a special waiver because my elementary school library did not have enough books near that difficulty to keep me busy. The only books I remember it having in that range were _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ and _Moby-Dick_. I liked _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ better because Jules Verne stayed on topic and didn't spend entire chapters rambling about white animals or the smell of animal fat.

I think very quickly, and solve puzzles and math problems so quickly I have been accused of having already known the answer. This will have serious consequences later.

In many other ways I am very, very stupid. I am a genius at reading and math, but when it comes to social skills I am the opposite. We say "learning disability" to be polite but the truth is I am retarded. I was bad at making eye contact and smiled at all the wrong times. I didn't understand small talk. If I did get into a conversation, I couldn't tell if the other person was interested, so I would just keep talking until they left. I often said things that were rude or made people uncomfortable without realizing it.

Sometimes the awkward things I would say were so un-childlike that they actually frightened adults. One Christian mother told her children not to play with me because she thought I was posessed by the devil. That hurt my feelings a lot, because I had a hard enough time making friends without adults going out of their way to make things worse. I had no friends at school going into sixth grade.

I never did make any friends at John Sevier Middle School. Instead, I was bullied. I was teased about how I was dirty and stupid and stuttered, about my glasses and pocket dictionary and how I knew the answers to questions in class. I was teased about not having friends. I was teased about being teased. Telling each other stories about me became a bonding experience for the other kids in my class.

Baiting me was a group activity; it became a competition to see who could get the biggest reaction out of me. One student told a teacher just entering the classroom that I had been cussing, when I had been reading quietly. Another made fun of my penis in the bathroom. It took me years to feel safe peeing at a urinal again.

Bullying and school violence were attracting a lot of attention that year. Columbine had happened less than two years ago, in 1999, and there were many more school shootings in 2000 and 2001. We had lockdown drills in case the school came under attack, treated as normally as fire and earthquake drills. Backpacks were to be kept inside our lockers during the school day, because it was feared that we might hide a weapon in one. Some of the shooters had been bullied, so every school had to have some kind of anti-bullying policy. I knew all of this because I read the newspaper.

I tried talking to our school's guidance counselor, but it didn't help. The only advice I got was to ignore people being mean to me. I still don't understand how ignoring people was going to solve my problem of not having any friends, but it didn't matter because 11 year old socially retarded me was unable to stop his face turning red when taunted. All that advice did was convince me that being bullied was my own fault for being weak and giving bullies the emotional reactions that they wanted.

A teacher or a guidance counselor sat down with me and some of the other kids to talk things out. The other kids said things like that they were just playing and didn't mean for me to take it personally and it wasn't their fault I couldn't take a joke. The adult told them that even though they weren't trying to hurt my feelings, they were, and they should stop because I couldn't take a joke. We all agreed that they would tease me less and I would learn to lighten up. That worked for maybe a day, and then the bullying got worse. I had escalated it by tattling to a teacher, and now they knew that the teachers weren't going to do anything.

I have heard adults say that bullying is an unavoidable and necessary part of growing up, that it teaches you to be tough and stand up for yourself. In children's books, there is a common theme of the main character learning a moral and using it to stand up to a bully. Often the moral is simply to stand up for yourself, show you're not afraid, and the bully will back off. If the bully doesn't back off, then there will be a good ol' fashioned fistfight. After the hero wins, everyone is impressed by his courage and wants to be his friend again. Very probably, a girl will kiss him.

I knew that fighting was wrong, even if someone else started it. I had taken a little Tae-Kwon-Do years ago, and while I didn't learn anything about how to actually fight, I did hear over and over again that violence was only to be used as a last resort.

I tried being nice.
I tried being mean.
I tried ignoring them.
I tried asking teachers.
I tried asking guidance counselors.

I think it is very dangerous to teach children that violence is the last resort, because they might believe you.

>[fight scene: weave images between sentences, as appropriate. This happens in slo-mo, "exploded storytelling" comic style.]

The first fight I got into was very stupid. I was walking down the hallway, carrying a huge stack of textbooks in my arms because we weren't allowed backpacks. Someone tripped me from behind. I fell on my face and all the books went sliding everywhere. It was a beautiful fall. I have tried to learn how to do a stage fall, like they do on television, and I will never be able to fall as perfectly as I did that day.

All around me, people began to laugh. I was humiliated. I don't think it was the physical attack as much as the sheer audacity that got to me. You can't trip someone and then say "I was just kidding." It wasn't even proper bullying. On television, bullies trip people and knock books out of their hands all the time, but I had never seen that happen in real life. It was the first time anyone had ever bullied my with physical violence.

I stood up. People were still laughing. I fixed on one boy. I don't know if he was the closest or just the first person I noticed. He was certainly the smallest boy there. And he was laughing at me. I completely lost it.

I don't remember much about the fight itself, except that I seriously wanted to hurt this kid. We were on the second floor balcony, over the atrium, and I tried to push him through the railing and over the edge. Fortunately, he didn't fit. Eventually, a teacher heard the cries of "Fight! Fight!," broke it up, and took us to the principals office. There was no clear winner or loser, even though I was much bigger than the other boy.

I also don't remember much about what happened in the principal's office. They interviewed me and some other kids, and it was discovered that someone other than the small boy I attacked had tripped me. I realized that this made sense: the small boy was more of a hanger-on than a primary bully anyway. His only crime was laughing at me when I fell &mdash; which I had to admit, must have looked pretty funny to someone watching. I apologized. My punishment from school was a day of in-school suspension, the minimum for fighting, as I had been provoked and it was my first offense. My parents grounded me for a much longer time. This seemed fair to me, because I knew that fighting was wrong and I had escalated the situation by throwing the first punch.

In school suspension was interesting. The suspended Problem Students sat at little desks facing the walls, with cubicle-style dividers between us. If we had homework, we were allowed to work on it, but there was to be no talking and we weren't allowed to leave our chairs. If you didn't have homework or had finished it, you were supposed to sit quietly for the rest of the school day.

>[image break: leaning in chair]

>
Angry man: looks to the right.
>
Angry man: HEY! NO LEANING BACK IN YOUR CHAIR!
>
Problem student leaning back in chair: Okaaaaaay.......
>
Angry man: AND NO BACK TALKING!

The proctor was a very loud, irritable man who based all of his actions around trying to catch us Problem Students breaking rules. To be fair, we were, if only because there was nothing better to do in suspension and kids generally try to live up to the expectations of the adults around them. One black girl with cornrows passed around a bag of mints to everyone in suspension without him noticing. Others simply vanished during lunch and earned themselves additional suspensions for running away from school. I think most suspensions were earned while the student was already in suspension.

That day in suspension, I told myself that I didn't belong with the Problem Students. It was true that I had been in a fight, but I was only defending myself. I had defended myself against an innocent bystander, but that was a mistake anyone could make. Tomorrow I would be out of suspension, never to return. When I got back to class, people wouldn't bully me anymore, because I had stood up for myself and shown that I couldn't be pushed around.

I was mistaken. It turns out that if an unpopular kid attacks a much smaller kid who didn't do anything to him, the unpopular kid is not suddenly treated as a hero. The whole day I was in suspension, the other boy and the eyewitnesses had been telling and re-telling the story of the fight. It was the most exciting thing that had happened since we got to watch the news in class back in September. The stories flew around the school, growing as it went, and by the time I came back to class _I_ was the bully!

Things went from bad to worse. I was now a bad guy, so students who weren't involved before could now look cool by "standing up" to me. I had also shown that if you teased me enough, I might do something much more interesting than turning red, tearing up, and yelling incoherently.

Other girls: Wow, you're so brave!

I wasn't physically intimidating at all, so the idea of getting into a fight with me was very exciting to my classmates.

I decided that my problem was in fighting the wrong person. If I had fought the person who actually tripped me instead of a random bystander, everything would have worked out better. I mentioned that in many ways I am very, very stupid, right?

The second fight also started in a hallway. I don't think it was between classes, because everyone was walking in the same direction and no one was carrying any textbooks. Someone tapped me on the shoulder. You know the ga>
Me: you tap someone on the shoulder, and then pull your hand back really fast and pretend like you didn't do anything. If you're good at it, you can tap them on the opposite shoulder and see if you can get them to blame someone else. I turned around.

>[image break]
>
Me: turns around.

Three boys: smiling meanly.

I decided that them middle boy had poked me, because he was the meanest and sort of the ringleader of that group of three. Even if he hadn't done it himself, he had probably put one of the other two up to it.

I didn't fight him right away. Even though I thought I could solve my problems and make friends by hitting the right people, I never actually started a fight until I was so angry that I went berserk. I always tried to be clever, but because I am very, very stupid, I wasn't actually clever. I slowed down my walking speed until I was behind Middle Kid, and tapped him on the shoulder. That would show him.

Me: taps Middle Kid on the shoulder.

It was working! I waited a little bit and did it again.

Clearly, I had hit revenge gold. The third time I did it, though:

Me: GAURAAAAUIUUAAAAAAAARGGGH!

I went down, him on top of me, and we wrestled and punched each other. I don't remember any more detail except that I tried to bang his head against the concrete wall in the hallway. These weren't play fights; the only reason I didn't give anyone a serious head injury is that I am pathetically bad at fighting.

Again, a teacher eventually noticed, pulled us apart, and marched us off to the principal's office. I was debriefed by a guidance counselor or an assistant principal while my parents were notified. In another room, Middle Kid said that he had not poked me, and his lackeys backed him up. I was given two days of in-school suspension for fighting, twice as many as the first time. This was expected: the way suspensions for fighting worked was that the first fight was 1 to 3 days of suspension, and each fight after that doubled the punishment. I asked how long Middle Kid was being suspended for, and was told that he was not being suspended at all, because I had provoked him.

Wait a minute.

In the first fight, I had been provoked by someone tripping me, not counting months of bullying. This was acknowledged by the school administration, and why I was given only one day of suspension instead of two or three. The smaller boy who I had attacked was technically fighting, because he had fought back when I attacked him. He was not suspended because he had only fought in self defense. All of this seemed reasonable and fair.

In the second fight, the situation was reversed. _He_ tackled _me_, and I only fought back in self defense. Even if you count tapping people on the shoulder as fighting, I was the one provoked and whoever tapped me in the first place should be suspended. I knew that I really had provoked him, and deserved some punishment, but he had thrown the first punch. It was always wrong to escalate the fight to physical violence, no matter what the other guy said or did. Otherwise, it would be okay to sock someone any time they called you a name.

I served the two days of in school suspension, while Middle Kid boasted to our classmates about how tough he was. The bullying and isolation became worse. The mean kids were even more aggressive. I was always a fun and easy target for them, but now Middle Kid had a grudge against me and he let everyone who wanted to be on his good side know it. The nicer kids wanted nothing to do with >
Me: I was clearly a bad person, because only bad people got suspsended.

I was desperate. I had tried violence, the last resort, and that had only made things worse. What do you do after the last resort doesn't work? I was tired and miserable and out of ideas. I decided to try talking to the guidance counselor. I had no reason to believe that would help &mdash; it hadn't helped before &mdash; but I decided to believe that it might. It was a deliberate act of faith, the kind you can only do if you truly believe you have nothing left to lose.

I contacted the guidance department and a meeting was promptly arranged.

[image: me and the guidance counselor in her office. I don't know what the minimum comic iconography to indicate a guidance counselor's office is - maybe one of those posters of smiley faces showing all of the emotions?]

But when talking with her, she didn't seem understand how upset I was, or even care. I realized that if I couldn't get her to understand, she wouldn't do anything and nothing would change. My last chance was slipping away.

>[image]
>
Me: extremely dramatic face
>
Her: :|

I decided to try hyperbole. I had told her "When people tease me, it makes me really mad," which was 100% true, but didn't show just how angry and miserable I was. I needed to take that truth and stretch it until it became exciting enough that she payed attention. I could have said "When people tease me, it makes me so mad that steam comes out of my ears", which happens in cartoons. I could have said "When people tease me, it makes me so mad that my anger turns into telekinesis and shoots out my eyes" which is kind of like what happened in _Matilda_, a book about another really smart kid who loved reading and was unfairly punished by her principal. I thought it was stupid that I had to say anything at all, because the guidance counselor already knew that I had gotten into two fights in two months and served three days of in-school suspension so obviously _something_ was wrong.

What I actually said was:

>[image]
>
Me: in large, arresting block letters: __When people tease me, it makes me so mad that I want to stab someone.__
>
Her: O_O

The guidance counselor did a very good job hiding her alarm. Well, since I am retarded at figuring out people's emotions, perhaps she only did an average job. All I noticed was that she was now paying attention to me which was what I was trying to get her to do.

>[image]
Her: Where would you get a knife?
>
Me: From the kitchen.

I answered instantly, because I am a very fast thinker and that was a very easy question. Where does your family keep knives? I didn't know the difference between a bread knife and a meat cleaver, but I knew they were both kept in the Sharp Things Drawer next to the can opener.

>[image]
>
Her: Where would you put it?

We were doing make-believe role-playing games! I immediately felt comfortable. I loved role-playing games, but I had learned not to talk about Dungeons & Dragons with strangers because in the Bible Belt a lot of people thought it was Satanic, like Harry Potter. Guidance counselors were the exception, because they understood the great psychological benefits of role-playing. Have I mentioned that I in many ways I am very, very stupid?

>[image]
>
Me: In an unused locker.

I again answered instantly, because I am a very fast thinker and I could solve puzzles so quickly that I was sometimes accused of having already known the answer. They had told us at the beginning of the school year that they were allowed to search our lockers for drugs and weapons, but there were a ton of unused, unlocked lockers lining the hallways. People only played with the ones near classrooms, so if you picked an unused locker in the middle of the hallway nobody would mess with it. If it was discovered by accident, you just had to not say anything and nobody would know that the drug or weapon was yours. If if they did suspect you personally of having something illegal, they wouldn't know to search your secret locker. I had given this no thought before she asked the question. I was proud of this answer because it seemed very clever to me and I had come up with it very quickly.

>[image]
Her: When would you use it?
>
Me: In the hallway, between classes.

This was another easy question, much easier than the one about the lockers. We had done plenty of lockdown drills, along with earthquake and fire drills. Lockdown drills always started in the classroom, because you needed a room to lock down _in_. Nobody would have any idea what to do, or even which teacher they were supposed to ask for directions, if something happened between classes. Some hallways were so packed full of students that you wouldn't even have to aim: it was impossible to swing your arm without hitting someone, much less a knife. Even after everybody figured out you had a weapon, they couldn't run away very easily on account of all of the other people panicking. Based on the teachers' response times to earlier fights, I figured that someone could stab three or four people before the teachers even noticed. I wasn't proud of this answer at all, because it was very obvious and someone really ought to have thought of it when planning the lockdown drills.

Looking back, I wonder if any other 11 year old in the world would have had both the intelligence to come up with those answers and the stupidity to say them out loud.

We talked a bit more, and then I went back to class, a little hopeful. She was _really_ paying attention to me by the end. Normally I had a hard time telling if people were interested in what I was talking about, but I had a good feeling about this one. A little later, a different guidance counselor poked her head into the classroom door.

>[image]
>
Awkward Counselor: sticks head in door. This was awkward, it should look awkward.
>
Me: head down on open book on desk.
>
Awkward Counselor: I need to borrow someone for something special.
Half the class, but not >
Me: raises hand.
>
Awkward Counselor: Hmmmm.
>
Awkward Counselor: No, it has to be someone who went to Washington Elementary.
Half the people with their hands up: lowers hands.
>
Me: still head down on open book on desk.
>
Awkward Counselor: Hmmmm.
>
Awkward Counselor: David, how about you? You went to Washington Elementary.
>
Me: I don't want to. There are a bunch of people who want to go, why don't you take one of them?
>
Awkward Counselor: No, no no. It really has to be you. Don't worry, you're not in trouble.

This caused quite bit of stir. I got up and left class with her. I am very, very stupid in many ways but this was suspicious even to me. Had I done something wrong? I tried to think of something I might have done wrong in the past couple of days and couldn't come up with anything worth pulling me out of class.

We went to her office, and she read me a picture book about a kid who had done something wrong and then felt guilty about it afterwards.

>[image]
>
Awkward Counselor: Have you ever done or said anything that you felt bad about later?
>
Awkward Counselor: Like today, perhaps?
>
Me: ... ?
>
Me: !!

I suddenly remembered about Zero Tolerance, and then I understood why the other guidance counselor had been paying so much attention.

Zero Tolerance was something I had read about in the newspapers. It was a policy designed to prevent school shootings like had happened in Columbine and California. The way it worked was that school administrators would not tolerate anything even related to violence, like talking about it. This was because in several of the school shootings, the shooters had talked about killing people but no one had taken them seriously until it was too late. Since teachers and principals were bad at deciding which students talking about guns and weapons were just normal kids goofing around and which were really going to shoot people, the solution was to force school administrators to treat them all as threats. That was the "Zero" in "Zero Tolerance": the schools would tolerate zero misunderstandings and zero joking around. Everything would be handled before it became too late.

The exact criteria for what counted as related to violence were kind of confusing, but strictly enforced. Kids had been expelled for drawing pictures of guns, but we learned about the Revolutionary and Civil Wars in class and those had lots of different kinds of guns and rifles. Being curious about different types of powder and barrels in History class was good, but being curious about them in the margins of your Math notebook was a serious offense. We played games with water balloons on Field Day, but even in elementary school we had been told that bringing a water gun to school could get you arrested. Who's to say that the water gun wasn't practice for a real gun later?

Priests and guidance counselors are a lot alike, in that they're people you can trust who will help you with your problems and keep them private. The difference is that Priests answer to God, who loves you unconditionally and is always ready to forgive you, while guidance counselors answer to Zero Tolerance.

>[image]
>
Me: ...no? Should I?

I knew she was talking about the questions about the drawer with the can opener and the unused lockers and the hallways between class, but I couldn't let her know that I knew. If I were talking my mom or dad, who loved me, I could have explained what had happened and that I didn't mean to scare anyone and apologize, but none of that would work on Zero Tolerance. Zero Tolerance didn't care what you meant or if you were sorry about it. If I allowed that I had made a threat, even to apologize for it, I knew that I would be expelled. My only defense was to have never said anything threatening in the first place, which was sort of true. I hadn't made a threat; it wasn't my fault if she heard something threatening! All I did was answer her off-topic questions. I resolved to disagree with everything the other guidance counselor said.

Even though I had come to hate school, I didn't want to be expelled. If I had told the guidance counselor that being teased upset me, and she responded by saying, "I can see why that's hurtful to you. Since you already know everything for sixth grade, how about you don't have to come to school any more this year?" I would have been ecstatic. But being expelled was the ultimate punishment, the worst possible for a student. It would make it permanent and official that I was a bad person. I didn't want to be a bad person. I could still remember when I loved school and loved learning back in kindergarten with Ms. Ferrell and Ms. Johnson. We had science fairs, and I built a fan-powered vehicle out of K'nex and smeared boogers on a petri dish and kept it in my closet for three years. There were fun books in the library and no one ever made fun of me for reading a book with too high a number on it because we didn't have Reading Grade Levels in North Carolina. I had planted an acorn back in first grade and we brought the sapling with us when we moved to Tennessee, and now it was a tree taller than I was. If I was expelled, I would lose all chance of going back to that ever again.

My mother was called in, and she had to talk to the principal and the guidance counselors and some other people. Sometimes I was involved in the conversation, sometimes not. I stuck to my plan of disagreeing with everything the other guidance counselor said I had said, except for when I admitted to saying certain things in order to explain why they didn't mean what the counselor thought they meant. I pointed out that she was the one who first used the word "knife," not me, and so by Zero Tolerance she ought to be the one who was expelled. None of my arguing got me anywhere. I was sent home from school indefinitely. The school didn't want me to come back until I had professional psychological help and they were certain I wasn't going to stab anyone. That sounded an awful lot like expulsion to me at the time. I don't know what my enforced absence was considered officially, but it wasn't explulsion because Tennessee schools are required to keep public records of suspensions and explusions, broken down by gender, race, and disability. Records from 2001 and 2002 show that only one student, a white female, was expelled from John Sevier Middle School during the time I was barred from school.

I actually already had a psychologist, a nice man named Dr. Burns, from problems I had been having back in 4th and 5th grade. I went to see him again, but it didn't go very well at first.

>[image: Dr. Burns's office]
Dr. Burns: How are you feeling today?
>
Me: sitting on middle of couch: I'm just a kid, I don't know anything!
>
Me: You're the one with the medical degree.
>
Me: hands up in air: You tell me!

I mostly did what Dr. Burns called "verbal sparring," which was his way of saying that I was as uncooperative as possible. My tactics ranged from disagreeing with definitions of common words, to interpreting all questions as literally as possible, to speaking only in one-word answers. My trust in adults had been completely shattered. I learned that the worst thing you could do, even worse than fighting, was to ask an adult for help. I was determined not to repeat that mistake.

I still, twelve years later, have flashbacks to that counselor poking her head into my English class whenever a supervisor asks to talk to me in private.

I was not doing well. We experimented with different kinds of drugs to fight my depression. I have heard well-meaning adults say that children are too young to have a serious mental illness and shouldn't be given psychoactive drugs. It's true that drugs like Prozac hadn't been tested well on children in 2001, and it's wrong to assume that drugs that work in adults will work the same way in children, but it is completely false to say that children are immune to severe clinical depression.

I thought a lot about suicide. I wasn't afraid of dying, because I still mostly believed in God and the afterlife. Catholic teaching says that suicide is the one sin that cannot be forgiven, not because killing yourself is worse than killing someone else, but because after you commit suicide you can't ask for forgiveness any more on account of being dead. But there was a way around that. You could commit suicide in such a way that you wouldn't die immediately and then pray for forgiveness between the point of no return and when you actually died. The people we watched jump from the burning World Trade Center towers had plenty of time to pray before they hit the ground, for example.

The tricky part would be how to go about doing it. I couldn't think of anything better than swallowing batteries or household cleaners. Those kill you by burning holes in your stomach and intestines. It is a very slow and painful way to die. I didn't want to suffer, but the bigger problem with a slow poison method is that it leaves a lot of time for someone to take you to a hospital and save your life. Then everyone would know you tried to commit suicide and lock you in a psychiatric hospital. I also wasn't sure how effective it would be. The stuff inside batteries was bad for you, but how long would the outer casing last in your stomach? Would you poop it out before it split open? How many AAAs would you need to swallow to make sure you died? I knew it was possible to kill yourself by drinking what the newspapers called "household cleaners," but the only specific dangerous one I knew of was [REDACTED], and I didn't think we had that home. Dish soap probably wasn't going to cut it; was laundry or dishwasher detergent good enough? Maybe old fashioned laundry detergent was dangerous but newer stuff was child safe. I really didn't want to guess wrong, because I had had enough of psychologists and guidance counselors and a failed suicide attempt would mean I would have to see more of them.

I told none of this to Dr. Burns or any other adult. If you have ever had any kind of psychological therapy, you know that the doctor askes, every visit, whether you have had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others. Dr. Burns asked, every time, and I deliberately lied to him, every time. I told myself it wasn't really lying, because I didn't _want_ to commit suicide, I just couldn't help thinking about it. I had learned that it was a trap question like "Where would you get the knife?" that would only make things worse if answered carelessly.

I was allowed to return to school early in the second semester. I had left in late October or possibly early November, so I was gone for several months. Between my parents, Dr. Burns, drugs, and being away from John Sevier Middle School, my mood had improved somewhat. I had role-played talking to other children with Dr. Burns, and I was starting to understand why physical violence couldn't solve a social problem. I decided to try to make friends again. I would to respond to any more bullying with pacifism, which I thought meant not punching, kicking, biting, hitting, wrestling, or injuring people.

School was a little better than before I had been kicked out. I was calmer coming out of my vacation, and some of the bullying had shifted to other kids when I wasn't around to pick on. The other kids knew that _something_ strange had happened that resulted in me being absent from school, but not what. Theories ranged from that I had moved away and then moved back, to that I had been in juvenile detention since November, to that the CIA had recruited me to help find Osama bin Laden.

I had regular meetings with the guidance department as a condition on returning to school. I still hated the guidance department, so the meetings weren't very helpful. Dr. Burns had earned back my trust in large part by being patient and friendly, but the guidance department had neither. Their response to my verbal sparring was to tell me that if I didn't cooperate I would be kicked out of school again, especially when I was right.

The first argument was actually on my very first day back in school, about the definition of the word "may." I had told that them that one of the places bullying occurred was in the unsupervised classrooms before school started, so they said I could go to the auditorium instead, where there were teachers. On the first day back, I decided to go to homeroom early as usual to get a head start making friends. The faculty panicked and nearly locked down the school looking for me.

>[image: classroom before school. Children are clustered in 2s and 4s, socializing. No teacher.]
>
Me: at desk with book, but talking to two children instead of reading it.
Awkard guidance counselor: sticks head in door, eyes bloodshot, panting.

They were extremely upset to find me sitting innocently in homeroom with a dozen other children. When they said that I "may go to auditorium before school" they had actually meant that I was absolutely required to go to the auditorium. I explained the differences between "may" and "must" to them, and they said to stop back-talking and that if I failed to follow directions again, I would be kicked out for real. This made me very anxious, but it ended up not mattering. The final incident would happen in the school cafeteria. John Sevier Middle School would never have to expel me.

Our school cafeteria was very loud and crowded. Most of the sixth grade boys in my class sat at one extra-long table in the back of the lunchroom. It was a great place to tell jokes and make fun of people because your audience was every other boy in the class. The bullies and popular kids, who were mostly the same people, liked the table because of that. I avoided it for exactly the same reason.

>[image: diagram of above. Two long tables in back &mdash; I think 12 students on each side? &mdash; one for boys, one for girls. The rest of the cafeteria is mostly round tables that sat 4-6 kids.]

I had realized that my problem wasn't so much not standing up for myself as not having any friends. Sitting by myself and reading a book worked for the lunch period, but to solve my problem I would have to make friends. To make friends I had to talk to people, and to talk to people I needed to be where they were. After returning to school, I decided to start eating lunch with the other boys.

>[image: lunch table with boys talking, laughing, and gesticulating. There is a teacher off to the left corner.]
>
Me: nervous, generally failing at small talk, but doing his best!
Boy across the table: Does your dad have a ... truck?
>
Me: No.
>
Me: He drives a car.
>
Boy: to people on his left: Did you hear that!  He said his dad doesn't have a truck!
>
Boy: to people on his right: His dad doesn't have a truu~uuuck. ♫
Other boys: laughter

Apparently, I had missed some new slang in my months away.

>>
Boy: leaning forward, face full of venom: Is that because you ... _bit it off_ in bed last night?


I was very angry, but I remembered that I was a pacifist now. I took a chicken nugget, dipped it in barbecue sauce, and rubbed it all over his face and hair.

>Dramatic imagery of me reaching across the table and doing the above.

He didn't do anything back. I think he was too surprised by my bizarre method of attack. A nearby teacher took him to wash the barbecue out of his hair. I'm fairly certain the teachers were aware of the incident &mdash; I might have been pulled into the principal's office again &mdash; but neither I nor anyone else received any punishment. It didn't count as a fight. My new strategy of nonviolence through food had worked! A very odd kind of nonviolence, but I was 11 and no one had taught me otherwise.

A few days later, I was once again at the boys' lunch table, seated third from the end. The same teacher was standing nearby again, less than ten feet away.

>[image: labeled diagram of seating arrangements: Nearby Teacher, top left. Diagonally down and to the right, Other Boy, seated at top left corner of table. Across from him, at other corner, is Final Boss Kid. To the right of Final Boss Kid is another kid and then me.]

It hadn't taken me long to realize that she was there to watch me and make sure I didn't pull out a knife in the cafeteria. I was annoyed at first, but I got over it when I realized that it meant she would be in place to intervene the next time I was bullied.

Sitting at the corner of the table was Final Boss Kid. Final Boss Kid was the meanest and angriest sixth grader in the whole school. Other bullies were careful to pick on unpopular kids like me to show off and look cool. Final Boss Kid just shoved people around when he got bored or antsy. I don't think he had any friends either. Everyone was a little afraid of him. The only good thing about Final Boss Kid was that he was often missing from class, due to a mixture of being suspended and playing hooky. I later found out that he was in some kind of special behavioral program. My mom said that he shouldn't have been in the cafeteria with the other kids in the first place, but in fairness his mom probably said the same thing about me.

Final Boss Kid was leaning forward into the face of the kid across from him, cussing him out. 

>[image: above scene. Nearby Teacher is in background, disinterested.]
>
FBK: much profanity. Not sure exactly how to represent this - people won't let kids read this if the words he used were printed clearly. I'm envisioning something like a miniature version of the psychic scenes with the evil priest-emperor in Nausicaa. Panels are going to become progressively more distorted/intense as we go, this is the climax. It's getting all Campbellian monomythological in here.
>
__TODO__: find reference scans of the relevant pages of Nausicaa.
>
Other kid: clearly uncomfortable but too afraid to say anything.

I don't think he was even saying real sentences, just a constant stream of profanity. Nearby Teacher was clearly in range to hear this, but she didn't care at all. The other kid clearly did, but was to afraid to say anything. I decided to be a hero.

>>
Me: TEACHER!
>
Me: Final Boss Kid is cussing at Other Kid!
>
FBK: his curse bubble is at least a little on-panel for all of these.
Nearby Teacher: 'kay.

I don't remember her exact words, whether they were "I know" or "Don't tattle" or an absentminded "No cursing in school" &mdash; but the meaning was clear: Don't bother me with your little problems.

Final Boss Kid did stop cursing at Other Kid, though.

>[images: I'm thinking these will work best from my first-person perspective. Again, exploded comics style - begin ramping up intensity here]
>
FBK: still cursing, as before.
>
FBK: curse bubble drains to empty.
>
FBK: stops.
>
FBK: looks at me.
>
FBK: to kid sitting between us: Switch me seats.
FBK + kid between us: switch seats.
>
FBK: leans into my face, restarts stream of profanity. (distortion starts)

He was saying some really bad words to me.

>panel perspective: I look to on Nearby Teacher, visible through curse bubbles. Her back is turned.
panel perspective: back to Final Boss Kid. He is beginning to blend in to his curse bubbles.

I tried to catch the eye of Nearby Teacher. I had practiced making eye contact, but I couldn't do it through the back of her head.

>panel perspective: back to Nearby Teacher, back still turned, now partially occluded by curse bubble clouds.
panel perspective: back to >
FBK: His skin has changed from brown to ash grey with ember red highlights, and his face is distorted and demonic. There is no clear separation between his body and the curses emanating from him.

I don't know whether I was more angry at the delinquent student facing me or at the delinquent teacher facing away.

>panel perspective: to lunch table. A bottle of blue Powerade is sitting on the lunch tray next to FBK, standing out against the oppressive grey curse-fog.
>
Me: picks up the Powerade, and pours it over FBK's head.
panel: >
FBK: as last time we saw him, but with a huge blue stream of Powerade pouring down the middle of the panel, as if extinguishing the grey-red fire that is now FKB. Completely abstract.
>
FBK: Dumbfounded. Art instantly snaps back to regular cartoon. FKB is just standing there, dripping Powerade.
>
BLACK PANEL

Cut to me, lying on the floor next to the table, arms at my side, surprised and motionless.

Then, very suddenly, I was lying with my back on the hard tile floor. Final Boss Kid was standing over me, now screaming profanity. He began kicking me in the head and chest. I did not fight back. This was my pacifism. He kept kicking me. I did not move to defend myself, even to protect my head. I probably should have, but I was dazed from the impact with the floor and his shoe. If you ever find yourself in this situation, at least cover your head. You can get serious brain damage or die this way. It took Nearby Teacher, whose only responsibility was to keep an eye on me, an eternity to notice and another eternity to pull Final Boss Kid off of me. Two teachers had to haul him away, still flailing and screaming profanity at the top of his lungs. I think I scared the teachers who came to rescue me, because I wasn't moving at all when they arrived. I hadn't lost consciousness apart from the bit between my chair and the ground. Actually, I was hyperfocused on keeping my body rigid and notfightingback-notfightingback-notfightingback. It took me some time to realize that it was safe to relax my body and breathe.

There was the usual trip to the principals office, but I was calm this time. I had won. I hadn't fought back even a little bit. No one could accuse me of fighting. I had learned the right moral and stood up the right way, by turning my cheek, like Jesus would have done. This time, justice would work correctly. While Final Boss Kid was suspended, I would tell everyone that getting kicked hadn't hurt at all, and they would all admire my courage and thank me for getting the one person they disliked even more than me suspended, earning us several days of peace until he returned. By then I hoped to have a whole network of friends to stand up to him.

I received four days of in school suspension, for my third offense of fighting.

He received one day of in-school suspension. Not for fighting, but for cursing at the teachers as they dragged him off of my motionless body.

I couldn't understand.

This was the last straw for my parents. They pulled me out of school and registered me as homeschooled. The next year, they registered me as an eighth grader. The year after that, my sister would have had to go to John Sevier Middle School. Instead, our whole family moved to Ohio, where my dad had grown up. My sister went to a completely different middle school, and I enrolled in the same elite private high school my dad had graduated from, St. Xavier High School. I was active in theatre, chess club, and co-founded the Role-Playing Games Club. I graduated with the highest possible score on my AP Calculus, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics tests, no major disciplinary problems &mdash; and most importantly, friends. Things were a bit rocky at first, with me being a year younger than everyone else on top of my retarded social development, but the caring teachers and guidance counselors at St. X helped me through my problems.
